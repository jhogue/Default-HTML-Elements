Default HTML Elements
======================

As many semantic, stylistic HTML elements as possible, labelled and explained with sample code. 

Designed as a set of HTML markup that can be used by designers and developers to check that 
their CSS covers all of the basics. A means of seeing all these elements and their associated 
styles in one place. 

The very basic CSS present here comes from [Oomphâ€™s Scaffold](https://github.com/oomphinc/scss-scaffold), 
which has only the necessary semantic defaults for legibility and usability.

#Dependencies

[Modernizr](http://modernizr.com) custom-build for `touch-event` detection, required by anchor link 
style declarations. 

[Smooth Scroll](https://github.com/cferdinandi/smooth-scroll) from Chris Fernandi just to make the 
anchor links prettier.
